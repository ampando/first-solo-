  <h2>Hi there! My name is Adrienne Matosich</h2>
  <h2 class="important">About Me</h2>
  
  <div class="box1"><p>Thanks for stopping by my page. I am <strong>new</strong> to the programming world, so <span class="highlight"><em>please</em></span> excuse the rough edges. I am coming from a career in the wine industry and after twenty plus years in hospitality I have decided to make a shift into something completely new.</p>
  </div>
  

  <h2 class="important">Why Tech, you ask?</h2>
  <div class="box2"><p>One of the many repercussions of the Pandemic was the crumbling of the restaurant industry. Typically, in good times and bad, people continue to eat and drink out, but for the first time, in a long while, restaurants were required to shutter. I was personally out of work for a year and a half. During that time I was able deeply reflect, on everything. I turned forty, around the same time and my priorities shifted in life-changing ways. I decided to give up alcohol, to be the healthiest version of me. I also went back to college to finish my bachelor's degree in Psychology, something which I never felt was necessary to do while studying and working in food and wine. Then the time came to pick a new direction for my future. Restaurants have never been known for their stability and security, but those are now two main driving forces for me. They pushed me to choose <strong>Epicodus</strong> on the recommendation of a former restaurant industry friend and recent Epicodus graduate, now working in tech.</p></div>
