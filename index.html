  <h2>Hi there! My name is Adrienne Matosich</h2>
  <h2 class="important">About Me</h2>
  
  <div class="box1"><p>Thanks for stopping by my page. I am <strong>new</strong> to the programming world, so <span class="highlight"><em>please</em></span> excuse the rough edges. I am coming from a career in the wine industry and after twenty plus years in hospitality I have decided to make a shift into something completely new.</p>
  </div>
  

  <h2 class="important">Why Tech, you ask?</h2>
  <div class="box2"><p>One of the many repercussions of the Pandemic was the crumbling of the restaurant industry. Typically, in good times and bad, people always eat and drink, but for the first time, in a long while, restaurants were required to shutter. I was personally out of work for a year and a half. I used that time to reflect deeply, on everything. Around the same time I turned forty, and my priorities shifted in life changing way. I decided to give up alcohol, to be the healthiest I could be. I decided to finish my bachelor's degree in Psychology, something that I never felt I needed to do while studying and working in food and wine. When the time came for me to decide which direction would set my future up with the most stability and security, something that the restaurant industry had been devoid of I chose <strong>Epicodus</strong> on the recommendation of a former restaurant industry friend and recent graduate, now working in tech.</p></div>
